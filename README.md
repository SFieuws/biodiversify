# Biodiversify
Biodiversify is an online tool that helps people to decide what plants to use in the garden. The tool focusses on the use of native plants in the garden to help biodiversity in your garden.

# Idea
- Based on your location, define if plant is native or not
- Allow search for native plants based on colour/height/ground type/amount of sun/nutrients in the soil...
- Help user to create a "biotope in the garden". This is a concept in Belgium used by [TuinRangers](https://www.tuinrangers.be/zelf-aan-de-slag/tuinbiotopen)
- Create management view to allow updating/creating plants
- Build community: create account, peer review updates and their sources
- Take an image from a flower mix and decide if the flowermix is native or not (probably based on latin names)
